            <p>I love eating pizza a lot. It is my favorite food. My mother is the person who makes pizza for me. There
                are
                different types of pizza but I love cheese pizza mostly.</p>

            <p>I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and
                to experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like
                to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to
                feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. I like to look at the
                clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle
                of the night. I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter. I like to
                sleep early, I like to get up late; I like to be alone, I like to be surrounded by people. I like
                country’s peace, I like metropolis’ noise; </p>

            <p>Foods are composed mainly of water, fat, protein, and carbohydrates. Cooking is the process of changing
                the chemistry of food usually by transferring energy to the food long enough so that it is safe and
                digestible, and achieves the desired flavor, texture, tenderness, juiciness, appearance, and nutrition.
